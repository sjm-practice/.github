GitHub Templates for Organization Projects
## Resources

## Workflows
- A workflow was created to automatically approve a PR, when a top level '-APPROVE-' comment was added to the PR by the owner. Note, GitHub Action approvals do not count toward required approvals for merging. So repo branch rules for this organization (or individual repos) will be set to zero. The '-APPROVAL-' comment action can still be used for audit trail purposes.
